This project compares the real-time inflation index to the RBI-issued inflation index using Data from Amazon Big Basket.

We checked the price history from time to time. using the account of the specific item price.

We made it in the format of an interactive dashboard using PowerBI 

For further improvement, we tried the country's economy based on the particular value of the CPI index. 

Below are some attached ScreenShots to show the dashboard
